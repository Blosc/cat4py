## Preliminaries

* Make sure that te current master branch is passing the tests on Microsoft Azure.

* Make sure that `RELEASE_NOTES.md` and `ANNOUNCE.md` are up to date with the latest news
in the release.

* Check any copyright listings and update them if necessary. You can use ``grep
  -i copyright`` to figure out where they might be.

* Commit the changes::

  $ git commit -a -m "Getting ready for release X.Y.Z"
  $ git push

* Check that the documentation is correctly created in https://cat4py.readthedocs.io.


## Tagging

* Create a signed tag ``X.Y.Z`` from ``master``.  Use the next message::

    $ git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Tagging version X.Y.Z"

* Push the tag to the github repo::

    $ git push
    $ git push --tags


## Packaging

* Make the tarball with the command::

  $ python setup.py sdist

Do a quick check that the tarball is sane.


## Uploading

* Register and upload it also in the PyPi repository::

    $ python setup.py sdist upload


## Announcing

* Send an announcement to the blosc lists.  Use the ``ANNOUNCE.md`` file as skeleton
(or possibly as the definitive version).

* Announce in Twitter via @Blosc2 account and rejoice.


##Â Post-release actions

* Create new headers for adding new features in ``RELEASE_NOTES.md``
  add this place-holder::

  XXX version-specific blurb XXX

* Commit your changes with::

  $ git commit -a -m"Post X.Y.Z release actions done"
  $ git push


That's all folks!
